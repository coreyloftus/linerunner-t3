# Urinetown

## Scene 6A (page 30)

### Old Man Strong

Bobby! Bobby, reason with the woman! I'm a little short this morning!

### Tiny Tom

No shorter than yesrterday. Unless I've grown.

### Bobby

Or, rather, something I didn't do.

### Hope

If it feels cold, then it must still be there, don't you think?

### Bobby

Unless there's a vacuum where it used to be.

### Hope

A vacuum? In your chest? It shounds so implausible.

### Bobby

I did something wrong this morning is all I'm trying to say. I can't seem to get it out of my head.

### Hope

The vacuum?

### Bobby

My action. I let someone down that I love dearly. I feel real bad about it.

### Hope

Well, maybe that's nature's way of telling you that now's the time to lift someone up?

### Bobby

Really?

### Hope

Sure. Do you think you'd be feeling as bad as you do if you didn't have a heart?
