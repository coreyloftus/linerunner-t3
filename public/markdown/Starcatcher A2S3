# Peter and the Starcatcher

## Act 2, Scene 3

### Fighting Prawn

You three will do nicely.

### Ted

You speak English!

### Fighting Prawn

If I must. Preferez-vous que je parle francais?

### Prentiss

But you’re savagaes!

### Fighting Prawn

We Mollusks are no savages. I know where savagery is, boy. When I was young man, English landed here, took me to YOUR island in chains. Many long years I serve as kitchen slave in Not-So-Great Britain. Until by kindness of fate

### Hawking Clam

— a shipwreck brought my father back to Mollusk Island.

### Fighting Prawn

Yes. In your language, my name is Fighting Prawn. This is my son, Hawking Clam.

### Fighting Prawn

My son shall wear this hat once worn
By my brutal British master.
For years, I was his kitchen slave.
He beat me raw, but I was brave
And one day put him in his grave
With a plate of poisoned pasta!

### Fighting Prawn

Thank you.

### Hawking Clam

Come, it is time.

### Prentiss

Time?

### Fighting Prawn

Feeding time.

### Ted

Feeding time, finally!

### Hawking Clam

Not where you eat, piggy boy. Where you are eaten.

### Fighting Prawn

You must answer to the law: the Law of Mister Grin.

### Prentiss

Who’s Mister Grin?

### Hawking Clam

We worship him, and he protects us from foreign trouble-makers.

### Fighting Prawn

Come, we feed you now to viscious crocodile.

### Peter

WAIT!!! Please don’t feed us to any crocodile. First — first take us to Mister Grin.

### Fighting Prawn

ANTI-PASTA! You said “gift”?

### Peter

A story — year, we’ll give you a bedtime story. Sleeping Beauty. Right, guys?

### Ted

Sleeping Beauty, yeah. The thing is, I nodded off before the end.

### PEter

Maybe they will too, and we can get outta here! We give you story, you let us live, and we leave your island. Deal?

### Fighting Prawn

Okey dokey. But if I am not entertained, it’s Mister Grin for all of you!! Assume the position! You have one minute!

### Ted

One minute? What’m I supposed to do in one minute? I can’t transform, I can’t inhabit the character —

### Fighting Prawn

Bring me the holy relic of my captivity!

### Hawking Clam

Here, Mighty Father. The kitchen timer.

### Fighting Prawn

One minute, starting… NOW!

### Prentiss

Um… One at a time —

### Ted

Once upon a time — that’s how they always start! Upon a time, upon a time!!

### Fighting Prawn

Tick-tock, tick-tock… hungry, Mister Grin?

### Prentiss

Okay, okay! Once upon a time, there was a beautiful baby Princess. Waaah!

### Ted

And an evil witch with a curse: A-ha-ha!

### Prentiss

Waaah!

### Ted

A-ha-ha!

### Prentiss

Waaah!

### Ted

A-ha-ha!

### Peter

And the curse was very terrible, for every time the baby cried —

### Prentiss

Waaah!

### Peter

— the whole kingdom would fall asleep!

### Prentiss

Waaah!

### Peter

(snores)

### Ted

A-ha-ha!

### Peter, Prentiss, Ted

And beauty was her name-oh!

### Prentiss

So the King marched over to his favorite horse!

### Ted

Naaayyy!

### Prentiss

And he rode to the tallest tree — and he climbed up to speak to the wise old owl!

### Ted

Whooo?

### Prentiss

The Kind, a real leader, sorta like me —

### Ted

Naaayyy!

### Prentiss

Focus, piggy Boy!

### Ted

PIGGY BOY?!?

### Peter

Sticky pudding!

### Ted

Sticky pudding, it’s so good…

### Fighting Prawn

Fifteen second, Mister Grin!

### Ted

And soon the princess was old enough to talk —

### Prentiss

Hi. I’m sixteen, I’m beautiful, and I’m in the market for something long-term.

### Peter

But nobody could stay awke long enought o kiss her!

### Prentiss

And everybody got so sleeepy all of a suddennnn…

### Ted

And that’s the story of Sticky Pudding —

### Peter, Prentiss

SLEEPING BEAUTY!

### Molly

That’s not the end! They missed the whole emotional arc of the story!

### Peter

Where’d you come from??

### Fighting Prawn

Goody, another English! And your minute is up!

### Peter

You shoulda stayed hidden, Molly!

### Molly

You abused the concept of the theater collective — it was too much for me.

### Mollusks

Molly! Molly! Molly!

### Molly

Although Ted has real talent.

### Prentiss

Hey, I have talent!

### Ted

They liked me! They really liked me!

### Mollusks

Molly! Molly! Molly!

### Peter

What’s so funny?

### Fighting Prawn

You called her “Molly”!

### Molly

Well, it’s my name. Molly. What?

### Fighting Prawn

In our language, “Molly” means squid poop.

### Hawking Clam

Wait! Entertained, Mighty Father?

### Fighting Prawn

First prize — you got me with squid poop. Two thumbs up! Two thumbs way up!

### Peter

So you let us live, right? That was the deal.

### Prentiss

Which is so great, see, ‘cuz you need us! We can do all the things you guys don’t wanna do anymore. We’re foreigners - that’s what we’re for!

### Fighting Prawn

Nice try. But, the law is the law! All English must die! CALAMARI!
