# Peter and the Starcatcher

## Scene 0 (Prologue)

### Boy

When I was a boy, I wished I could fly.

### Prentiss

Me too.

### Scott

So did I!

### Boy

Out the window and over the trees --

### Smee

-- high as a cloud and lighter than air --

### Molly

-- then loop the loop and up to the stars! I dreamed about flying all the time. What? Girls dream.

### Boy

Up to the stars - I like that.

### Molly

Me too.

### Aster

Eventually, of course, we dream other dreams.

### Prentiss

We change.

### Ted

We grow up.

### Aster

It always happens. Nothing is forever.

### Boy

That's the rule.

### Molly

Everything ends.

### Stache

And so our story begins.

### Smee

Supposing all these planks and ropes are now the British Empire...

### Aster

And we are lords --

### Scott

-- and captains --

### Molly

-- mothers --

### Prentiss

-- orphans --

### Alf

-- sailors --

### Stache

-- pirates --

### Fighting Prawn

--- tropical kings.

### Scott

And use your thougths to hoist the sails and deck the ships awaiting us this early, gray and mistay dawn in 1885 --
